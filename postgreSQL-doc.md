### Architecture Overview

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82403362-fb44-4c94-90bf-61266e9cb356)

- **Process-based model:** Each connection gets a separate process for isolation and performance.
- **Shared Buffers:** Caches data pages to speed up operations.
- **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):** Ensures data durability even during crashes.
- **Background Workers:** Handles maintenance tasks like autovacuum and replication.
- **Extensible Plugins:** Add new functionalities without altering core PostgreSQL.

### Creating and Managing a PostgreSQL Database
| Rule                 | Description                                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Installation**     | Use the [PostgreSQL POC](https://github.com/snaatak-Downtime-Crew/Documentation/tree/SCRUMS-86-Vardaan/ot-ms-understanding/postgressql/poc#step-by-step-setup-guide) for a step-by-step setup guide. |
| **Database Creation**| Use the `CREATE DATABASE` command to create a new database instance.                        |
| **Schema Definition**| Design your schema using `CREATE TABLE`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `PRIMARY KEY`, and data types.       |
| **Data Manipulation**| Use `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `SELECT` commands to manage data.                      |
| **User Management**  | Use `CREATE ROLE`, `GRANT`, and `REVOKE` to manage users and their permissions.              |
| **Backup and Recovery** | Use `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, and replication to ensure data durability.                    |

---

### Common SQL Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `CREATE DATABASE dbname;` | Create a new database. |
| `CREATE TABLE tablename (column1 TYPE, column2 TYPE);` | Create a new table. |
| `INSERT INTO tablename (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);` | Insert a new row. |
| `SELECT * FROM tablename;` | Retrieve all data from a table. |
| `UPDATE tablename SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;` | Update data. |
| `DELETE FROM tablename WHERE condition;` | Delete specific rows. |
| `DROP TABLE tablename;` | Delete a table. |
| `ALTER TABLE tablename ADD COLUMN columnname TYPE;` | Modify a table structure. |

### Best Practices
- Always use connection pooling (e.g., PgBouncer) for high concurrency.
- Regularly analyze and vacuum tables to optimize performance.
- Backup databases regularly using `pg_dump` and test restores.
- Use indexes wisely but avoid over-indexing which can slow down inserts.
- Apply appropriate constraints to maintain data integrity.
- Secure database by managing roles and applying SSL.
- Monitor performance using tools like `pg_stat_activity` and `pg_stat_statements`.
