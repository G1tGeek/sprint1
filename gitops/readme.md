## Introduction

This documentation outlines the core concepts and practical value of the jq command-line tool, highlighting why it was created, what it offers, and how its features align with modern data processing and automation requirements in software development.

## What is GitOps?

GitOps is a modern operational framework that applies Git-based workflows to infrastructure and application deployment. It relies on Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications, allowing changes to be managed through pull requests and automatically applied via continuous delivery tools.

## Why GitOps?

> - **Declarative infrastructure**: Ensures all system configurations are version-controlled and reproducible.
> - **Auditability**: Tracks all changes through Git history.
> - **Automation**: Streamlines deployment processes with CI/CD integration.
> - **Reliability**: Reduces configuration drift and enhances system stability.

## Popular GitOps Tools

There are several popular tools used in GitOps practices. Below are some of the key ones:

> - **Argo CD**: A declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
> - **Flux**: A GitOps operator that synchronizes configuration from Git to Kubernetes.
> - **Jenkins X**: Built on Jenkins, designed specifically for Kubernetes CI/CD with GitOps.
> - **Spinnaker**: A multi-cloud continuous delivery platform with support for GitOps workflows.
> - **Rancher Fleet**: Focuses on managing large-scale Kubernetes clusters with GitOps.
> - **Weave GitOps**: Built on Flux with enterprise-grade features.
